# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: March 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I completed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ1OA9Wyf2U&list=WL&index=83) basic tutorial on React from Alvin.

**Thoughts** I needed a calming win after my mock interview. Quite nervous for tomorrow. First time using semantic ui, wow I see why it's so popular.
